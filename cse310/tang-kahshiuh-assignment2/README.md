The file is run by doing

```bash

$ python3 analysis_pcap_tcp.py

```

inside a terminal inside this folder

You need to make sure the assignment2.pcap is in the same file hierarchy as the file you are trying to run. Also, ds.py has the data structures I used in the assignment.

You will need to have dpkt and socket libraries downlaoded for the program to run.
