Part 1:
- To calculate the different flows, I used a map to keep track of unique src/dest ip/port combinations. I consider the key that you would recieve to be the same as the one you would send. 

- I used enums to keep track of the state a flow was in. I would print out the SEQ, ACK numbers and Recieve Window size when I sent the first 

- I would keep track of how many bytes I has sent starting with the first SYN packet to the last ACK packet. I would also keep track of the time of the first and last packet sent. Dividing these two gave me the throughput.

Part 2:
- I calculate the first RTT by using the time difference between the first SYN and SYN/ACK response. I would recalculate the window size every RTT, but I would nto ever actually recalculate the RTT value. I would look at the MAX amount of packets out during the this timeframe and call that the congestion window size. 

- To keep track of the retransmissions, I looked at how many time any SEQ number was sent out. Every time I saw that a second SEQ number was sent out, I would check to see if I had recieved 1 ACK for it or many ACKs for it. If I had recieved many ACKs, this would indicate that this was a FAST retransmit due to triple duplicate ACK. If I had recieved only one ACK before, I would consider this a retransmission.
